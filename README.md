Description: 

1. Install the Markov Stability Function in the michaelschaub-PartitionStability-8e2b9ee folder, github link: https://github.com/michaelschaub/PartitionStability
2. Run UKBDataPreparation.m
3. Run UKBStructuralClustering.m
4. Use the function GetStableCluster.m to get the desired cluster result for cortical thickness, surface area, volume and subcortical volumes
